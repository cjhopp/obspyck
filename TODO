- need to check the hopping to sample time during picking, esp. on data from arclink with 20Hz, also with varying starttimes

low priority:
- link not clickable in textedit (using showMap with origin data present)
- move all combobox initializations from the qt_designer to dynamic setup using (new) dicts in util.py (see setup of phase_type combobox in __init__)
- check if extending SEISMIC_PHASES works dynamically
- replace rpy in wadati plot by scipy routines
- remove most of the info messages?? they take lots of lines and are really not that interesting (initially partly for debugging)
- check if we really ned all the axes remembering and manual deleting, somehow this was necessary at some point but I still think this could be done easier/simpler/clearer...
- write some doc, esp. on internal structure of data (all the dicts and stuff)
